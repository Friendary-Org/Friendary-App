Nice to know:
- Default categories need to be created over the debug screen when starting the app for the first time (star icon on main page)

Issues we are aware of and will be fixed in the final version:
- when a friend is edited, the changes are not immediately visible on the view of the edited friend (reload required)
- when a new category is created, a reload is required so that the new category is visible in the dropdown filter of the main page
- there is sometimes a small black dot above categories, which might be the divider (we have to figure it out ;-) )
- some buttons that are clicked in a short period of time multiple times might result in an error
